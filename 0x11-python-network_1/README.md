# Resources

This repository contains code and documentation related to learning how to fetch internet resources using Python packages `urllib` and `requests`. The project aims to help you understand the process of fetching internet resources, decoding response bodies, making different types of HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, etc.), working with JSON resources, and manipulating data from external services.

# Resources

Read or watch the following resources:

- [HOWTO Fetch Internet Resources Using urllib Package](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/urllib2.html)
- [Quickstart with Requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)
- [Requests package](https://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain the following topics without relying on external sources:

**General**
- Fetching internet resources using the `urllib` package in Python
- Decoding response bodies received from `urllib`
- Working with the `requests` package in Python, which simplifies the process compared to `urllib`
- Making HTTP GET requests using `requests`
- Making various types of HTTP requests such as POST, PUT, etc. using `requests`
- Fetching JSON resources using Python
- Manipulating data obtained from external services
